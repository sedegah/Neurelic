#RAGify: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
RAGify is a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines document retrieval with natural language generation to answer user queries. By utilizing Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings, FAISS for efficient document retrieval, and GPT-2 for generating contextually rich responses, RAGify offers intelligent, accurate, and context-aware answers.#


Introduction
RAGify integrates document retrieval and natural language generation into one seamless system. It retrieves relevant documents based on user queries and generates natural language responses by leveraging powerful generative models like GPT-2. This approach ensures that responses are contextually enriched with information from the retrieved documents.

How It Works
User Query: The user submits a query (e.g., "What is machine learning?").

Query Encoding: The query is encoded into a vector (embedding) using Sentence-Transformers, capturing its semantic meaning.

Document Retrieval: Using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), the system retrieves the most relevant documents based on their similarity to the query.

Context Fusion: The retrieved documents are combined with the original query to form a rich context that guides the generation.

Answer Generation: GPT-2 generates a response using the combined query and document context.

Response Output: The generated answer is returned to the user in natural language.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up RAGify locally:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/sedegah/RAGify.git
cd RAGify
2. Install Dependencies
It is recommended to use a virtual environment. Install the required dependencies with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required Dependencies:
transformers (for GPT-2 model)

sentence-transformers (for document embeddings)

faiss-cpu (for efficient document retrieval)

torch (for PyTorch and GPT-2)

3. Download Pretrained Models
Sentence-Transformer: The paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2 model will be automatically downloaded the first time you run the code.

GPT-2: The GPT-2 model is also automatically downloaded using the transformers library.

Usage
Run the RAG System
Prepare Your Documents: Replace the sample documents in the script with your own text corpus, stored as a list of strings.

Invoke the RAG System: Use the following code to get a generated response:

python
Copy
Edit
from ragify import rag_system

# Define your query
query = "What is machine learning?"

# Call the system
response = rag_system(query, documents)

# Print the generated response
print("Generated Response:", response)
This will:

Encode the query and documents.

Retrieve the most relevant documents.

Generate a contextually relevant response using GPT-2.

Customization
Document Corpus: Customize the document corpus to suit your use case by replacing the default sample documents with your own.

Retrieval Settings: Adjust the top-k parameter to control the number of documents retrieved during the search.

Fine-Tuning GPT-2: For more domain-specific responses, fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your own dataset.

System Architecture
Document Corpus: A collection of documents that serve as the knowledge base for answering queries. It can be any text dataset like articles, FAQs, or research papers.

Retrieval System (FAISS): FAISS enables fast similarity searches within high-dimensional data, allowing the system to efficiently retrieve relevant documents based on the queryâ€™s embedding.

Query Embedding: The query is transformed into an embedding using Sentence-Transformer. This embedding is used to find the most semantically similar documents in the corpus.

Generative Model (GPT-2): After retrieving relevant documents, GPT-2 is used to generate a detailed response based on the query and the context provided by the documents.

Output: The system returns a natural language response to the user that answers the query, using information from the retrieved documents.

Example Use Case
Customer Support Bot
Imagine you're building a customer support bot. You have a set of knowledge base articles, and you want the bot to provide context-aware answers. Using RAGify, the system:

Retrieves relevant help articles based on the user's question.

Combines the retrieved documents with the query.

Generates a response using GPT-2, ensuring that the answer is accurate and contextual.

For example, if a user asks, "How do I reset my password?", the system might generate:
"To reset your password, navigate to the login page and click on 'Forgot password'. You will receive an email with a link to reset your password."
